# Path-finders


I created this to experiment with and visualize different search / path-finding algorithms.
This project includes a maze generator to provide an environment to demonstrate differnet path finding algorithms.

So far the following algorithms have been implemented:
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
